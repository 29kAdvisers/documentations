Effort Estimations (Staffing & Manpower): 
A continuous and evoling process
Each milestone can be handled in parallel with minimum/low dependency
Setup would involve dependency on 3rd Party/Vendors as Stakeholders, effective timelines can only be deduced after detailed breakdown
Post the complete setup and implementation - An infrastructure Team of at least 2 members until the org holds upto 100 employees. 
Post which an agile team would be the best fit with size deducing the stability and frequencies of org's changes. 

Timeline Estimations: 
Continous Implementatation with parallel developments. Office Server Setup to be ready within 4 months time, meanwhile the requirement of 
rest of the policies and setup can be completed within the next 9-10 months. 

Budget Estimations: 
These are ball-park estimates EXCLUDING Hardware and related maintenance-
Current Costing    ~20LPA (for 10 employees)
Estimated Costing  ~40LPA (for upto 100 employees)
